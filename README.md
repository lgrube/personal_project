i will be creating the original snake game into a SPA
i've created a style sheet which is labeled snake.css
I've created a javascript template which will hold all
	my code to make the snake interact with stuff
	that is labeled snake.js
I've created the basic game.html file which will serve
	as the link for all the other files
